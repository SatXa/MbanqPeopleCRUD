# MbanqPeopleCRUD

Note: sql_create_table_person.sql is for the creation of the Person table I used. I just had a couple of randomly-generated names and numbers in it (PS - I didn't know the format for TIN so I just used whatever)

I have done a couple of these tasks before, although never all of them as a whole project. I realize it is a bit CRUDe, and while attempting to insert a duplicated TIN won't work, it'll actually crash the project too. Since I usually write small console apps, this was out of my scope, but it was fun using bits of pieces of what I've learned at work and trying to make them work in the project, with varying degrees of success.

The bulk_insert.xml is the XML file I used to insert some new data in the database, and sql_server_person_img.jpg shows the result.
